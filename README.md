# Compression using Nvidia CUDA

## **Summary**

<p>

This project aims to accelerate lossless file compression with parallel computing using Nvidia CUDA.<br>
**Compression ratio** and **time to compression** metrics will be the main focus.<br>
Comparsions will be made between diffrent kinds of setups.<br>
